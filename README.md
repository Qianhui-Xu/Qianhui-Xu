-  Hi, I’m @Qianhui-Xu
-  I’m interested in physics, mostly theoretical, but I have a background in studying quantum materials (crystals).
-  I’m currently learning Group Theory, and Quantum Field Theory.
-  I like physics and philosophy, they are the ways to understand our universe.
-  And I also like literary like poems, which means romance of life.
-  Reach me: qianhui001@e.ntu.edu.sg
-  Welcome to the wikipidea website that I co-write with another physicist Wang Yuzhu, which contains the classical questions in condensed matter physics (access from NTU network is required):
