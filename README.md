-  Hi, I’m @Qianhui-Xu
-  I’m interested in physics, mostly theoretical, but I have a background in studying quantum materials (crystals).
-  I’m currently learning Group Theory, and Quantum Field Theory (very slowly and intermittently).
-  I am interested in physics, philosophy, and religions. I think they are human's ways to understand our universe.
-  And I also like literary like poems, which means romance of life.
-  Reach me: qianhui001@e.ntu.edu.sg
-  Welcome to the wikipidea website that I co-write my current group members, which contains some interesting contents and questions in condensed matter physics (access from NTU network is required):
